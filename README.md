‚ùóTo generate a new component use `yarn gen:sb` or `yarn gen` commands:

To generate the first level use the `yarn gen:sb <Component Name> <Optional: Has Variant>`, for example:

```console
yarn gen:sb <Component Name> <Optional: Has Variant>
```
Example to generate a new component:
```console
yarn gen MyComponent true
```
> This will generate a new component inside the src directory with the proper structure using variants file.

To generate child component use the path:

`yarn gen <Component Name> false <Parent Component Name>`

Example:
```console
yarn gen ChildComponent false MyComponent
```
To next level:
```console
yarn gen NextChildComponent false MyComponent/ChildComponent
```

## Rules üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
- Mobile first.
- Prioritize stateless over stateful components.
- Do not "hadouken ü•¶" the functions.
- Complex functions must have unit tests.
- Ue [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/) to create a component.

### External library
Avoid use external library. use just if really needed. This library.

> Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!

### Accessibility
- Use ARIA: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA

- Include keyboard navigation.
- Add a visible state of focus.

### Unit Tests
‚ùóEverything core component parts should be tested, avoiding unnecessary tests.

- Try coverage all state of the component with relevant actions unit tests.
